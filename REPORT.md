## Summary and Reflection

In this submission, I created a Flutter app for managing flashcards within decks. Users can add, edit, delete, and sort flashcards alphabetically. The app uses `StatefulWidgets` to update the display when changes are made. However, data persistence is not implemented yet, so flashcards won't save between sessions. While the main features work, there is room for improvement in error handling and the overall design for better user experience.

I enjoyed working on this project because it helped me improve my Flutter skills and learn more about app development. However, I disliked using SQLite. I wish I had known more about alternative data storage options before starting this project.
